Feature: Pricing Matrix - price creation validation to prevent duplicates - BPP-2114
  As a Senior Product Setter
  I want to there to be validation that prevents Prices based on the combinations that have already been setup being created again,
  so that I do not create duplicate Prices, as this will break Course Price lookup.
