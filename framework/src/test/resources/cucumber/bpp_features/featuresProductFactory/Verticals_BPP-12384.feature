  As a Salesforce that manages clients
  I want to to be able to see what verticals my clients is purchasing
  So that I can measure client growth against agreed strategic KPIs, Average Verticals per Client

  As a member of course setup, I expect to be able to manage the 'Verticals' that are available (for Body) within Product Factory.
