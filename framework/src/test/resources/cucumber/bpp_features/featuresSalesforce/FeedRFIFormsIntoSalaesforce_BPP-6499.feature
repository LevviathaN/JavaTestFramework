@Salesforce @FeedRFI
Feature: To Feed RFI Form
  As a user, when I submit an RFI form on BPP.com or on the "Events App", then an Activity (Task), Lead or Account should be created / updated with relevant fields in Sales Cloud in near-real time.
  The middleware will make a REST API call to Salesforce with the RFI form data.
