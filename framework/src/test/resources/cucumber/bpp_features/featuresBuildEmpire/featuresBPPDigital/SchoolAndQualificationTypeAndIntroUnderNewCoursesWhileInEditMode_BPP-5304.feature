Feature: BPP Digital Edit New Course page to see School and Qualification type and Intro
  As an admin
  when editing a 'New Course' type CMS page
  I expect to see the field "school", "qualification type" and "intro"
  Which should work in the same way as the options seen under "programmes"

  Background:
    Given I execute "Log In to Hub as Admin" reusable step
